## Notes

**Action Cards**                                                           
Choose one Action Card each turn that combines movement and attack. Choose wisely as it's what will get you out of your predicaments!

**Dungeons of Tiles**                                                           
The dungeons are filled with tiles containing various effects. Use the effects of the tiles to your advantage and wipe out the enemy.

**Varying Playstyle**                                                          
As you progress through the dungeon, you can acquire new weapons and upgrades, gradually morphing the way you play. Find the playstyle that suits you and aim for the dungeon's depths.
