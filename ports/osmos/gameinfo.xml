    <desc>Osmos is a serene, physics‑based puzzle game where you control a tiny “mote” that grows by absorbing smaller ones while avoiding larger predators, all propelled by ejecting your own mass to move. Each level challenges you to balance growth and movement, with 72 stages set across ambient, sentient, antimatter, and gravitational-force environments, accompanied by a hypnotic electronic soundtrack and minimalist visuals.</desc>
