Hi Tristan,

I'm thrilled to hear that you'd like to include my game in your software package. I'm also a fan of retro handhelds, although I haven't yet had the chance to try one with a Linux system ...

Wishing you all the best with your project!

Blasin

Hi, Blasin

My name is Tristan, and I'm part of a group of developers working on porting games to handheld Linux devices. Our project is named PortMaster, and we also have an active Discord server.

Recently, we've started adding various LÃ–VE games to these systems, and I'd like to include your Road Invaders game as well. I've observed various homebrew sites simply distributing files without permission. However, we firmly believe in contacting authors like you to ask for consent.

Could you grant us permission to include your game files in our packages? Users would otherwise have to download the files from Itch.io to add them manually. Your game would undoubtedly be a superb addition to these handheld devices.

Just so you know -- we are not looking to profit or take credit for any of the games. Our primary goal is to introduce more games to our beloved handheld devices, and we're also branching out to other ARM platforms.

Thank you for considering our request!

Best regards
Tristan
